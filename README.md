# DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash on 4×GB10 / SGLang TP4

r0b0tlab · @mr_r0b0t — official checkpoint, vision retained, local file-backed Engram lookup, static DSpark K5. Original adapter and reproducible runtime package; no model weights distributed.

Campaign state: RETRIEVAL_NOT_QUALIFIED. This is a measured profile, not a fastest-hardware or long-term-stability claim.

## Final-image results

| Lane | Result | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| Q200v2 | 189/200 (94.50%) | Text180 + official BFCL structural-hard20; thinking on, effort low |
| Text180 | 175/180 | All rows normally terminated; independent manual review included |
| cvbench | 39/60 (65.00%) | Thinking off; one worker; bounded CV-Bench first60 / full MMVP300 |
| mmvp | 205/300 (68.33%) | Thinking off; one worker; bounded CV-Bench first60 / full MMVP300 |
| MMVP paired | 74/150 | Both answers correct in each pair |
| NIAH 512k | INFRA_FAILURE | Exactly one ordered two-key 33%/66% case; not a 25/50/90 ladder |
| NIAH 1m | PENDING | Exactly one ordered two-key 33%/66% case; not a 25/50/90 ladder |

| Q200 family | Correct | Total |
|---|---|---|

Manual review corrects erroneous frozen references for three cases. One answer is rejected for an incorrect additional continuous-time claim despite a correct discrete recurrence. See MANUAL-REVIEW-POLICY.json; scores are bound to unchanged response hashes. Historical overlay-v1 192/200 is not the score of this image.

## Throughput: read each workload separately

Custom primary/counting rates use server usage tokens and real complete-client elapsed time. Thinking is off. Primary/counting values are medians of three measured repetitions after one excluded warmup. They include request prefill, not pure decode. Fixed-token synthetic rows are intentionally capped and are not semantic-answer quality scores.

| Workload | K5 aggregate output tok/s | K3 comparison tok/s |
|---|---|---|
| short_c1 | 30.75 | 25.87 |
| medium_c1 | 11.22 | 13.41 |
| prose_c1 | 6.77 | 9.69 |

K5 retained by the predeclared no-regression rule; K3 has higher medium/prose and geometric-mean throughput but regresses short. Not a universal speed winner.

| Counting workload | Aggregate output tok/s |
|---|---|
| counting_c1 | 58.33 |
| counting_c4 | 112.75 |

| Requested concurrency | Sustained observed | Completed | Errors | Aggregate output tok/s |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | 17 | 0 | 55.55 |
| 2 | 2 | 28 | 0 | 85.94 |
| 4 | 4 | 36 | 0 | 110.48 |
| 8 | 8 | 48 | 0 | 136.67 |

Load-counter caveat: Pinned load_inquirer.py:100 counts len(get_running_batch().reqs), without filtering finished requests. Raw c4 count transiently exceeded client concurrency; raw maxima retained and only sustained exact levels qualified. Original rc1 receipt retained.

## Native SGLang bench_serving

| Cell | Completed | Sampled input/output maxima | Retokenized E2E tok/s | Harness nominal tok/s | Mean TTFT ms |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| bench-short-c1 | 20 | 128/128 | 8.36 | 8.37 | 1869.7 |
| bench-short-c8 | 20 | 128/128 | 11.40 | 11.43 | 10687.1 |
| bench-medium-c1 | 20 | 2048/512 | 10.16 | 10.19 | 6798.5 |
| bench-medium-c8 | 20 | 2048/512 | 7.07 | 7.08 | 31598.6 |

Native cells use seed42 and random_range_ratio0: uniformly sampled lengths from1 to the displayed maxima, with ShareGPT-derived text, not fixed-length shapes. Harness nominal output counts can fall back to requested lengths if stream usage is absent; the decoded-response retokenized E2E rate is shown separately. Nominal input totals exclude any extra chat-template tokens. These rows are not interchangeable with the custom primary or quality workload rates.

NVML samples are not wall-outlet power. HTTP output throughput includes prefill and reasoning; not pure decode. No prefill-only rate inferred. Stopped-epoch samples excluded by exact lane bounds.

A real NVRM allocation failure occurred during the first BFCL attempt after text180. All four guards stopped the runtime; those BFCL outputs are infrastructure-invalid, not scored model failures. Text180 was preserved unchanged and unfinished lanes were retried in a fresh identical-image/profile epoch. This recovery does not claim to repair the underlying allocation failure or establish indefinite service stability.

The first medium-c8 warmup later failed with an asynchronous CUDA illegal-memory-access error reported by rank0 NCCL. The three preceding native cells and completed Q200 were preserved. The missing cell is tested in another identical-image/profile epoch; the failure is retained and no originating kernel or stability repair is claimed.

Both512K execution attempts returned no answer after GPU allocation errors, including the identical-case replay in a cold epoch.512K is NOT retrieval-qualified; this is infrastructure failure, not a model retrieval miss. Host safety fixes require privileged kernel-journal visibility and10GiB resident-free admission and preserve primary errors. The separate1M C1 profile uses native allocator proactive reclamation at threshold0.6 with expansion off; an exact-image CUDA oracle verifies the setting, but full-model effectiveness is not assumed or transferred to production quality/performance.

Optional dedicated 2h mixed-workload soak: NOT_RUN. Completed serial evaluations are not relabeled as that soak.
